## Spreadsheet

This is a spreadsheet-like app that runs completely client-side and is implemented using Preact, hooks, [`use-workerized-reducer`][uwr] and `eval()`.

Developed by [Surma] and [Luca Casonato] as a continuation of a coding interview question from this [blog post].

### Development

$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
